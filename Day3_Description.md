# Day 3: Advent of Code 2023

Day 3 was a fun Christmas challenge. It took a lot of testing to get right, as I really struggled with keeping line-length numbers right. I had many an "IndexError: list index out of range" errors during this challenge.

But otherwise the logic of it was fun to think through. I expected challenger 2 to be harder, but after sleeping on it I saw the steps I needed to take quite clearly before I even had a chance to read some kind advice from the Arjan Codes Discord that reinforced my thinking.

I'm trying to make an effort to practice clear variable names and using typing. A goal for future challenges will be to try to organize my code more professionally. I've seen some repos where folks create modules for each dat and have a main file/function which can run them all.

I'd also like to get in the habit of writing out a short unit test for the test data before I begin coding. Maybe for day 5!
