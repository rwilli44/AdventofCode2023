# Day 7: Advent of Code 2023

Today's mission involved sorting hands of cards by value, and I don't love my solution: it is the longest IF sequence I have ever written and may it hold that position forever. I look forward to coming back to this to try to refactor it, but time is short so done is better than good.

I got to use the List.reverse() function I learned from discussion of a previous challenge on the Arjan Codes discord. And I also got to use "for i, value in enumerate(list)" and "dictionary.get(value, default)" both of which I just read about in Python Beyond the Basics, so I consider the challenges a success!
