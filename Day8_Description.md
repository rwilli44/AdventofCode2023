# Day 8: Advent of Code 2023

Day 8 part one was refreshingly simple, though I know it would have taken me much longer if I hadn't already completed the past seven days of challenges.
Part 2 looks challening but very do-able, though I am going to save it for another day as I'll be up early to walk a neighbor's dog.
