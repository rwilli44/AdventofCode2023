# Day 5: Advent of Code 2023

Day 5 was a DOOZY. I first looked at it around midnight and had no idea what it was asking me to do. After a decent sleep, I saw what needed to be done, but definitely didn't go about the most efficient way of doing it. My code took somewhere between 10 and 12 hours to complete challenge 2... but it was right!

I can already see one mistake I made: using "in range()" instead of comparison operators which would be more efficient. I look forward to refactoring this one in the future.
